description: "Use Mintlify’s OpenAPI or a collection to exercise Waftpay endpoints, including auth, Collections, Payouts, and TSQ."
---

You can drive Waftpay endpoints directly from **Postman**. Choose one of these flows.

## Option A — Import OpenAPI

1. In Postman, click **Import** → **Link** and paste your docs OpenAPI URL (e.g., `/openapi/waftpay.json` from your docs host).
2. Postman will create a Collection with all endpoints (e.g., **Collections Initiate**, **TSQ**, **Payouts**).
3. Create an **Environment** with variables:
   - `base_url` = `https://payments-api.dev.pockets-pay.com`
   - `access_token` = *(paste your Bearer token value)*
   - `x_custom_signature` = *(for signed endpoints — paste precomputed signature)*
4. In each request, set the `Authorization` header to `Bearer {{access_token}}` and the URL to `{{base_url}}` + path.

## Option B — Download our collection

If you prefer a curated collection and examples, export the endpoints from OpenAPI (or ask us for a ready-made JSON).

## Notes

- For **Payouts** and **Remittance**, compute `X-Custom-Signature` externally (private key usage in Postman isn’t recommended) and paste the Base64 value into the header before sending.
- For **Collections**, no signature is required.
- Timestamps in examples use **UTC** and **end with `Z`**.
