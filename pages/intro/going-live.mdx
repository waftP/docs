# Going Live

When youâ€™re ready to switch from **sandbox** to **production**, follow this checklist:

## âœ… Go-live checklist
- [ ] **End-to-end tested** in sandbox with sample flows.
- [ ] **Webhook endpoint** is live, secure (HTTPS), and signature verification is implemented.
- [ ] **Error handling** and **retry logic** tested.
- [ ] **UI/UX messaging** updated for real customers.
- [ ] **Compliance docs** (KYC, business verification) submitted and approved.

## ðŸ”’ Security reminders
- Never expose your **Client Secret** in frontend code.
- Rotate credentials if you suspect compromise.
- Use TLS (HTTPS) everywhere.

## ðŸŽ‰ Launch
- Switch your API base URL to the **Production URL**.
- Replace sandbox credentials with **production credentials**.
- Start processing live customer transactions.

ðŸ‘‰ Once live, monitor your dashboard closely to ensure everything runs smoothly.
