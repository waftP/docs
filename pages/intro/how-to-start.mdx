# How to Start

Hereâ€™s how to get up and running with Waftpay:

## 1. Sign up for a developer account
- Visit the [Waftpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.dev.pockets-pay.com).
- Create an account and request API credentials.

## 2. Generate API credentials
- Youâ€™ll get a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (per environment).
- Store them securely â€” they are your keys to the platform.

## 3. Authenticate
- Call the **OAuth token endpoint** to exchange your credentials for a **bearer token**.
- Use this token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all requests.

## 4. Make your first API call
- Try the **Health Check** (`/actuator/health`) to confirm connectivity.
- Then, create a **test payment** in the sandbox environment.

## 5. Set up webhooks
- Implement webhook handlers to listen for payment updates.
- Validate signatures using your configured signing secret.

ðŸ‘‰ Thatâ€™s it â€” now youâ€™re ready to explore collections, payouts, and more.
