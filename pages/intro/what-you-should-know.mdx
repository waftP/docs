# What You Should Know

Before integrating Waftpay APIs, here are the essentials:

## 1. Environments
- **Sandbox (Dev)**: Test everything with fake money.
- **Production (Live)**: Real customers and real transactions.
- Each environment has its **own base URL** and **API credentials**.

## 2. Authentication
- Waftpay uses **OAuth2 Client Credentials**.
- Your backend exchanges a **Client ID** + **Client Secret** for a **short-lived bearer token**.

## 3. Currency & Regions
- All transactions are in **KES (Kenyan Shilling)** for now.
- Expansion to more currencies will be announced soon.

## 4. Webhooks
- Waftpay notifies you about **transaction updates** via webhooks.
- Always verify signatures to ensure authenticity.

## 5. Error Handling
- APIs return **standardized error codes**.
- Handle gracefully â€” retry where safe, or alert users when manual action is required.

ðŸ‘‰ Keep these in mind, and your integration will be smoother.
