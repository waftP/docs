#### We never receive webhooks
- Verify your callback URL is **publicly reachable** (no VPN/IP allowlist blocking).
- Ensure your endpoint accepts `POST application/json`.
- Check server logs for non-2xx responses; we only consider **200 / 201 / 202** delivered.

#### We get duplicates
- Retries can cause re-delivery. Implement **idempotency** with `payment_uuid` or `client_reference`.

#### Signature mismatch
- Ensure you build the hash exactly as documented (no separators, consistent string formats).  
- Watch out for number formatting on `amount`.

#### Timeouts
- Read the body, **persist**, and return **2xx** quickly; do heavy work async.

#### Metadata not present
- `metadata` is optional; code defensively.
