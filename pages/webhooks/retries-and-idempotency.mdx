title: Retries & Idempotency
description: Delivery guarantees, retry policy, and how to make your endpoint idempotent.

## Delivery behavior

- We `POST` to your callback URL and treat **HTTP 200/201/202** as delivered.
- On non-2xx or network/timeout errors, we **retry** after a short delay, up to a small maximum number of attempts.  
- After the maximum is reached, we stop retrying.

> **Your responsibility:** Always return a 2xx once youâ€™ve **safely persisted** the event.

## Building idempotency

Webhooks may arrive **more than once** (e.g., retries, network jitter). Implement idempotency using any of:

- **Dedup key**: `payment_uuid` (primary) and/or `transaction_reference` (your `client_reference`).  
- **Upsert** logic keyed by `payment_uuid`, updating status if it changes.
- **Exactly-once side effects**: persist first, enqueue internal work, then return 2xx.

### Recommended database structure

| Column                | Purpose                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| id (auto)            | Internal primary key             |
| payment_uuid (uniq)  | Dedup key                        |
| client_reference     | Your reference                   |
| last_status          | Last delivered status            |
| last_code            | Code mapped to status            |
| payload_json         | Raw payload for audit/debug      |
| processed_at         | When you confirmed delivery      |
