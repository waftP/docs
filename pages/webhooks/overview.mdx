description: How Waftpay notifies your system about payment status changes via webhooks.
---

Webhooks let Waftpay notify your server about payment status events (e.g., `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `PENDING`). 
Your system exposes a **callback URL** (HTTPS recommended) that accepts a JSON `POST`. 
We automatically retry a few times if your endpoint is temporarily unavailable.

#### What you’ll implement
1. A publicly reachable **HTTPS POST** endpoint (your callback URL).
2. Logic to **validate** the payload and verify its integrity.
3. **Idempotency** handling to avoid double-processing.
4. A fast **2xx** response on success.

#### Event lifecycle (high level)
- We process the payment event → transform it into a client-friendly payload → `POST` it to your callback URL. 
- We treat HTTP **200/201/202** as delivered; non-2xx or timeouts trigger retries (up to a small, configurable maximum).

> **Note**: Webhooks report status; they don’t accept commands. Use the Payments API for actions.
