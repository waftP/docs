title: Test & Simulate
description: Send sample webhooks to your endpoint in sandbox.

Use our sandbox to simulate webhook deliveries to your callback URL.

## Quick start (cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://sandbox.waftpay.io/api/developer-tools/webhooks/send-test \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "callback_url": "https://merchant.example.com/webhooks/payments",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "code": "102",
    "amount": 1000,
    "client_reference": "TRD99672118069255",
    "payment_uuid": "422664585064023059",
    "payment_id": 145,
    "metadata": { "note": "Test delivery" }
  }'
```

> The simulator **sends** a webhook to your `callback_url` using the same payload format as production (see [Webhook payload](/pages/webhooks/payload)).  
> In your logs, confirm receipt and your 2xx response.
