Below are the primary event types you may see during **Collections**, **Payouts**, **Remittance**, and **Refunds** flows.

> Subscribe by providing a `callback_url` in your request. Each event includes a top-level `type`, `id`, `created` (RFC3339, ends with `Z`), and a `data` object.

## Collections

- `collection.accepted` — We accepted your request (`202`). Includes `payment_uuid`.
- `collection.succeeded` — Funds confirmed.
- `collection.failed` — Provider rejected.
- `collection.refunded` — Refund completed (full or partial).

## Payouts

- `payout.accepted` — We accepted your request.
- `payout.succeeded` — Beneficiary received funds.
- `payout.failed` — Provider rejected or timed out.

## Remittance

- `remittance.accepted`
- `remittance.succeeded`
- `remittance.failed`

## Refunds

- `refund.accepted` — Refund request queued.
- `refund.succeeded` — Funds returned to payer.
- `refund.failed` — Refund could not be completed (see `result_code`).

## Delivery & retries

- We retry on non-2xx or timeouts with exponential backoff (up to the contract window).
- Keep handlers **idempotent** and verify signatures as described in **Webhooks — Signature Verification**.
