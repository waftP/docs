title: "Status Checks"
description: "Poll the latest status when webhooks are delayed or unavailable."
---

Use status checks as a fallback when you cannot rely on webhooks (temporary outages, firewalls, or delayed deliveries).

---

## Endpoint

**POST** `/payments-tsq-service/v1/query/payments`

**Auth**: Use the Bearer token for the product you are querying (Payouts, Collections, or Remittance).

---

## Request body

Provide **one** of the following fields:

- `transaction_reference`
- `payment_uuid`
- `request_uuid`

### Example (by transaction reference)

```json
{ "transaction_reference": "TXN123654671" }
```

### Example (by payment UUID)

```json
{ "payment_uuid": "8363546214883574601" }
```

---

## Example response (processing)

```json
{
  "status": "200.100",
  "code": "ACCEPTED",
  "description": "Accepted for processing",
  "data": {
    "amount": 1000,
    "total_charges": 0,
    "total_amount": 1000,
    "transaction_reference": "TXN123654671",
    "payment_uuid": "8363546214883574601",
    "payment_reference": "1RJITP5HLL",
    "state": "processing",
    "time_received": "2025-04-04T06:15:10.102993Z",
    "last_updated": "2025-04-04T06:16:44.442001Z"
  }
}
```

## Best practices

- Poll only when necessary; prefer webhooks.
- Use backoff (5s -> 10s -> 30s -> 60s) and stop after a sensible max window.
- Cache last known status to reduce repeated queries.
