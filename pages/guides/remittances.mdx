Remittances transfer funds between financial entities (domestic or crossâ€‘border). The flow mirrors payouts/collections with additional **KYC** fields.

---

## 1) Endpoint & Headers

**POST** `/payments-api-service/v1/remittances`

Headers and signing are identical to payouts (same canonical string & rules).

---

## 2) Request Body (example)

```json

  "transaction": {
    "reference": "TXN123654573",
    "amount": "100.00",

**KYC Guidance**
- Provide full legal **name**, **DOB**, **nationality**, and **ID type** if the corridor mandates it.  
- We may request additional attributes depending on corridor/regulator.

---

## 3) Acceptance & Completion

- **HTTP 202** upon acceptance (same envelope as payouts).  
- Webhook provides **final result** with downstream references, timestamps, and `payment_uuid`.

---

## 4) Corridor & Currency Considerations

- Always sign with the **same `currency`** you send in the payload.  
- Ensure FX conversions (if any) are handled by your upstream system before you submit the remittance unless your commercial setup includes FX.

---

## 5) Compliance & Risk

- Ensure sanctions/PEP screening where applicable.  
- We may block or pend transactions for additional review; in that case, TSQ shows `PENDING/REVIEW` until resolved.

---

## 6) Error & Retry Strategy

- Use **idempotent** retries with the same `X-Idempotency-Key` on transient errors (HTTP `5xx`, `429`).  
- Do **not** retry `400`/`403` without fixing the root cause.
