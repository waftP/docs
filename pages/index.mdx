# Welcome to Waftpay Developer Docs

Waftpay makes it easy to **collect payments, send payouts, and reconcile transactions** with a single API.
This documentation will guide you through authentication, endpoints, and best practices.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

- Get your **API keys** from the [Waftpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.waftpay.io).
- Use our [sandbox environment](https://sandbox.waftpay.io) to test before going live.
- Authenticate using a **Bearer token** from `/auth/token`.

Follow the [Quickstart guide](./quickstart) to make your first API call.

---

## 🔑 Core Concepts

- **Authentication** – Secure every API call with Authentication bearer tokens.
- **Idempotency** – Retry safely with the `Idempotency-Key` header.
- **Webhooks** – Get real-time updates for payments and payouts.
- **Errors** – All errors return standardized codes and messages.
