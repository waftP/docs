# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Waftpay Developer Docs

Waftpay makes it easy to **collect payments, send payouts, and reconcile transactions** with a single API.
This documentation will guide you through authentication, endpoints, and best practices.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

- Get your **API keys** from the [Waftpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.waftpay.io).
- Use our [sandbox environment](https://sandbox.waftpay.io) to test before going live.
- Authenticate using a **Bearer token** from `/oauth/token`.

ðŸ‘‰ Follow the [Quickstart guide](./quickstart) to make your first API call.

## ðŸ”‘ Core Concepts

- **Authentication** â€“ Secure every API call with OAuth2 bearer tokens.
