# Waftpay Developer Docs

Build payment, collection, and remittance flows with a single API. This guide focuses on the practical steps: auth, request signing, idempotency, and webhooks.

---

## Quickstart

1. Create a sandbox account and get your API keys from the [Waftpay Dashboard](https://app.dev.waftpay.io/sign-in).
2. Generate a Bearer token with the [Authentication API](/api-reference/auth/auth-token).
3. Send your first request from the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart).
4. Add a webhook endpoint to receive final status updates.

---

## Core concepts

- **Authentication**: Bearer tokens for every request. See [Auth token](/api-reference/auth/auth-token).
- **Signatures**: RSA signing for sensitive requests. See [Signature generation](/api-reference/signatures/signature-generate).
- **Idempotency**: Safe retries with `Idempotency-Key`. See [Idempotency and retries](/pages/idempotency-and-retries).
- **Webhooks**: Real-time events for payments and payouts. See [Webhooks overview](/pages/webhooks/overview).
- **Errors**: Consistent error shape and codes. See [Errors](/errors).
- **Environments**: Sandbox vs production base URLs. See [Environments](/environments).
