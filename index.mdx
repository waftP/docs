Waftpay helps you **collect payments, send payouts, and reconcile transactions** with a single API. This guide focuses on the essentials: auth, signatures, idempotency, and webhooks.

---

## Quickstart

1. Sign in to the [Waftpay Dashboard](https://app.dev.waftpay.io/sign-in) and grab your API keys.
2. Create a Bearer token via the [Authentication API](/api-reference/auth/auth-token).
3. Make your first request using the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart).
4. Add a webhook endpoint to receive final status updates.

---

## Core concepts

- **Authentication**: Bearer tokens for every request.
- **Signatures**: RSA signing for sensitive requests.
- **Idempotency**: Safe retries with `Idempotency-Key`.
- **Webhooks**: Real-time events for payments and payouts.
- **Errors**: Consistent error shape and codes.
- **Environments**: Sandbox vs production base URLs.
