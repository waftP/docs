All endpoints return errors with a consistent, machine-readable shape. This page shows the structure, how to interpret it step-by-step, and a catalog of common error codes.

## Standard error shape

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_request",
  "message": "msisdn is required",
  "param": "source.msisdn",
  "request_id": "req_abc123",
  "code": "400.001.300",
  "status": "REJECTED"
}
```

### Field reference

- **error**  High-level category (`invalid_request`, `authentication_error`, `authorization_error`, `validation_error`, `service_error`, etc.).
- **message**  Human‑readable explanation. Safe to show in logs and dashboards.
- **param**  The field that caused the error (if applicable).
- **request_id**  Unique ID for this request. Always include this when contacting support.
- **code**  Waftpay extended error code (explained below).
- **status**  Business outcome for this request (`ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, or `ERROR`).

> Some responses may also include a `details` object with extra validation information for batch or nested payloads.

---

## The Waftpay extended error code

We append a structured code to the standard HTTP status to make troubleshooting fast:

```
<HTTP>.<SERVICE>.<SPECIFIC>
```

- **HTTP**  The HTTP status class (e.g., `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `500`, `202`).
- **SERVICE**  The internal service identifier. In the examples below, `001` represents the Payments/Payouts flow.
- **SPECIFIC**  The precise reason within that service (e.g., missing field, invalid currency, database error).

**Example**: `400.001.304` : HTTP **400** (Bad Request) • Service **001** • Reason **invalid currency**.

You’ll see the HTTP status in the response and the extended code in the body (and our logs). Use both together when searching runbooks or talking to support.

---

## Outcomes vs. HTTP statuses

- **ACCEPTED (202)**  The request passed validation and was queued for processing. Final state will arrive via your `callback_url`.
- **REJECTED (4xx)**  The request is invalid or not permitted. Fix the request before retrying.
- **ERROR (5xx)**  A temporary error on our side. You may retry with backoff and idempotency.

---

## How to troubleshoot (step-by-step)

1. **Read the HTTP status**  
   `4xx` : your request needs fixing (don’t blind‑retry).  
   `5xx` : transient service issue (safe to retry with backoff).  
   `202` : accepted asynchronously; wait for the callback.
2. **Check `code` and `status`**  
   `code` pinpoints the exact cause (e.g., `400.001.307` = invalid URL).  
   `status` tells you whether the request was accepted, rejected, or errored.
3. **Use `param` to find the faulty field** (e.g., `transaction.amount`).  
4. **Act based on the family**
   - **Validation (400.001.xxx):** fix the payload (type/format/range/required).
   - **Auth (401/403):** verify Bearer token, signature, and access rights.
   - **Business rules (e.g., duplicate reference):** change inputs or reference IDs.
   - **Service (500.xxx):** retry with exponential backoff and idempotency keys.
5. **Log `request_id`** for correlation across your systems. Include it in support tickets.
6. **For 202 Accepted**, track state via your **`callback_url`** (final success/failure) or a **GET status** endpoint where applicable.

## Common error codes (Service `001`  Payments/Payouts)

> The **Service** column is `001` in these examples. Other products will use their own service ID but keep the same pattern.

| HTTP | Code        | Status    | Description                              |
|-----:|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|

| 404  | 404.001.000 | REJECTED  | Resource not found                         |

> If you see a code not in this table, read it using the same `<HTTP>.<SERVICE>.<SPECIFIC>` pattern and check the endpoint’s section for any service‑specific codes.

## Example responses

### 1) Validation error (missing field)

```json
{
  "error": "validation_error",
  "message": "transaction.amount is required",
  "param": "transaction.amount",
  "request_id": "req_4xk92F",
  "code": "400.001.300",
  "status": "REJECTED"
}
```

**Fix:** Provide `transaction.amount` as an integer ≥ the minimum allowed.

### 2) Authentication error (bad token)

```json
{
  "error": "authentication_error",
  "message": "Invalid Bearer token",
  "request_id": "req_Kh2J0P",
  "code": "401.001.000",
  "status": "REJECTED"
}
```

**Fix:** Refresh OAuth token and send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

### 3) Signature validation failed

```json
{
  "error": "invalid_signature",
  "message": "Signature does not match",
  "request_id": "req_Qp1a9N",
  "code": "400.001.400",
  "status": "REJECTED"
}
```

**Fix:** Recreate the signature exactly as described in **Signing Requests** (canonical string, algorithm, headers, key).

### 4) Accepted for processing (async)

```json
{
  "message": "Accepted",
  "request_id": "req_B8u5mA",
  "code": "200.001.000",
  "status": "ACCEPTED"
}
```

**Next:** Wait for your final webhook to the configured `callback_url`.

### 5) Service error (retryable)

```json
{
  "error": "service_error",
  "message": "Temporary outage",
  "request_id": "req_t71m2Z",
  "code": "500.001.000",
  "status": "ERROR"
}
```

**Fix:** Retry with exponential backoff and an **idempotency key**.

## Programmatic handling

Below is a simple handler to centralize error interpretation on the client side.

```ts
type WaftpayError = {
  error?: string;
  message?: string;
  param?: string;
  request_id?: string;
  code?: string;
  status?: string;
};

export function interpretError(res: Response, body: WaftpayError) {
  const http = res.status;
  const code = body.code || "";
  const status = body.status || (http >= 500 ? "ERROR" : http >= 400 ? "REJECTED" : "ACCEPTED");

  const [httpPart, servicePart, specificPart] = code.split(".");

  return {
    http,
    status,
    service: servicePart,
    specific: specificPart,
    isRetryable: http >= 500,
    isValidation: http === 400 || code.startsWith("400."),
    message: body.message,
    param: body.param,
    requestId: body.request_id
  };
}
```

## Best practices

- **Always log** `request_id`, `code`, `status`, `error`, and `message`.
- **Use idempotency keys** on POSTs to avoid duplicates on retries.
- **Don’t retry 4xx** (unless you’ve corrected the payload or credentials).
- **Backoff on 5xx** (`500.001.xxx`) and monitor for sustained failures.
- **Validate locally** (types, formats, required fields) before sending.
- **Secure your auth** (valid OAuth Bearer token) and **sign requests** exactly as specified.
- **Whitelist your `callback_url`** and ensure it is an **HTTPS** URL that returns **2xx** swiftly.

## Glossary

- **Duplicate reference**  Your `transaction.reference` was already used; supply a new unique value.
- **Invalid currency**  Currency not supported or wrong ISO 4217 code for the target flow.
- **Invalid timestamp / format**  Use ISO‑8601 (e.g., `2025-01-21T12:30:10Z`).
- **Invalid URL**  `callback_url` must be a valid `https://` URI.
- **Service access not allowed**  Your client is not permitted to call this operation or product; contact support if this seems wrong.
- **Signature validation failed**  The computed signature doesn’t match ours; re‑derive it using the documented string‑to‑sign and key.
