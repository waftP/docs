# Payment Requests

The **Payment Requests** APIs allow you to move money through Waftpay in three different ways:

- **Payouts** – Disburse funds from your account to customers, vendors, or partners.
- **Remittance** – Move money between accounts, including cross-border transfers.
- **Collections** – Accept payments from customers through mobile money or other supported channels.
- **Refunds** – Within collections, request for refunds of payments.
- **Reversals** – Within collections, request for reversals of payments from customers.

## Authentication Tokens

Each flow (**Payouts, Remittance, Collections**) requires its **own authentication token**.
These tokens are **not interchangeable**  you cannot use a Payout token to initiate a Collection, and vice versa.
However, a user will use the **Collections** token to initiate a reversal or a refund **ONLY**.

## How It Works

First, generate a public key and a private key. One you have done this, add the public key to the dashbboard inorder for you to generate
an authentication token using your **Customer Key** and **Customer Secret** from the [Authentication API](/api-reference/auth/auth-token).
Then, include the token in the `Authorization` header when making API requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
