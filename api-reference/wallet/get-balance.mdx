title: "Get Balance"
description: "Fetch wallet balances for the authenticated product (collections, payouts, etc.). Filter by currency or fetch all."
openapi: "GET /payments-tsq-service/v1/wallet-balances"
---

Fetch wallet balances associated with the **product tied to your token** (e.g., *Collections*, *Payouts*).
Optionally filter by a specific `currency` (e.g., `KES`). If omitted, **all balances** for the product are returned.

> **Base URL (Sandbox)**

> `{{payments_tsq_base_url}}`

## Endpoint

```http
GET /payments-tsq-service/v1/wallet-balances?currency={CURRENCY}
```

## Authentication

This endpoint **requires** a Bearer token that is **scoped to the product** you are querying (e.g., a *Collections* token can only view Collections balances; a *Payouts* token can only view Payouts balances).

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

If the token is invalid, expired, or not authorized for the requested product, you'll receive `401 Unauthorized`.

## Query parameters

| Name     | In    | Type   | Required | Description                                        |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| currency | query | string | No       | ISO currency code (e.g., `KES`, `UGX`). If omitted, returns all balances for the product tied to your token. |

## Behavior & constraints

- **Product scoping:** The Bearer token determines which product’s wallets are visible (e.g., Collections vs Payouts).
- **Filtering:** `currency` is optional; when omitted, all provisioned wallets for the token’s product are returned.
- **Idempotency:** This is a `GET` and does not change state; no idempotency key required.
- **Caching:** Avoid caching balances client‑side if you need real‑time accuracy.
- **Rate limits:** Standard platform rate limits apply. Handle `429` with retries and backoff.
