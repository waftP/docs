# OAuth2 – Client Credentials Flow

The Waftpay API uses **OAuth2 Client Credentials** for server-to-server authentication.
This flow is **not a user login** – you do not pass email or password here. Instead, your application authenticates using a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** that Waftpay issues to you.

---

## How to Use this

- API keys and secrets should never be exposed in logs or error messages.
- Use **Client ID + Client Secret** when your **server application** (backend) calls Waftpay APIs directly.
- Do **not** embed secrets in browsers or mobile apps. If you need user login (e.g. phone + password), see the **User Login Authentication** section.

## When to use this

- Use **Client ID + Client Secret** when your **server application** (backend) calls Waftpay APIs directly.
- Do **not** embed secrets in browsers or mobile apps. If you need user login (e.g. phone + password), see the **User Login Authentication** section.
