title: "Get Authentication Token"
description: "Exchange consumer credentials for a short-lived Bearer token."
openapi: "POST /authentication-service/v1/api/generate-token"
---

## Overview

Use this endpoint to exchange your **consumer_key** and **consumer_secret** for a short-lived Bearer token. This is a server-to-server flow and does **not** require an existing Bearer token.

---

## Request body

```json
{
  "consumer_key": "APP_CONSUMER_KEY",
  "consumer_secret": "APP_CONSUMER_SECRET"
}
```

---

## Example response (success)

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Request processed successfully",
  "token": "abcdeFGHIjklmno@1234567890...",
  "expires_in": 7200000
}
```

Use the token in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

---

## Notes

- Use the credentials for the **specific product** you are calling (Payouts, Collections, or Remittance).
- If you regenerate your keys, the old credentials stop working immediately.
