# Authentication Token – Client Credentials Flow

The Waftpay API uses **Client Credentials** for server-to-server authentication.
This flow is **not a user login** – you do not pass email or password here. Instead, your application authenticates using a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** issued to you after onboarding.

---

## Token Types

There are **three types of tokens** that can be generated, each tied to your use case:

- **Payout Token** – used when making disbursements (sending funds out).
- **Collection Token** – used when receiving payments from customers.
- **Remittance Token** – used for moving money across accounts or cross-border transfers.

All tokens are requested from this same endpoint, using your API key and secret.

## Where to Find Your API Key and Secret

Once onboarded to Waftpay:

1. Log into the **Waftpay Client Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Developer → Settings**.
3. Copy your **API Key** and **API Secret**.
4. Create a **Private Key** and a **Public Key**. This will be specifically used for **Remittance** and **Payouts** requests. The **RSA Algorithm should be size 256**.

These map to the `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` parameters in your request body.

note
If you regenerate your API key/secret in the dashboard, the **previous credentials become invalid immediately**.
