# Authentication Token – Client Credentials Flow

The Waftpay API uses **Client Credentials** for server-to-server authentication.
This flow is **not a user login** – you do not pass email or password. Your application authenticates using a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** issued during onboarding.

---

## Token Types

There are **three token types**, each tied to your use case:

- **Payout Token** – sending funds out (disbursements).
- **Collection Token** – receiving funds from customers and handling refunds and reversals.
- **Remittance Token** – account-to-account or cross-border movement.

All tokens are requested from this same endpoint using your key/secret.

## Where to Find Your API Key and Secret

1. Log into the **Waftpay Client Dashboard**.
2. Go to **Developer → Settings**.
3. Copy your **API Key** and **API Secret** (maps to `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`).
4. (If required by your product) Generate **RSA keys** for request signing (e.g., payouts/remittance). Use **RSA-2048** with **SHA-256** signatures.

<Note>
    If you regenerate your key/secret in the dashboard, the **previous credentials become invalid immediately**.
</Note>
