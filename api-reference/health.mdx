# Health Check Endpoint

The **Health Check** endpoint lets you verify that the Waftpay API is online and reachable.
It’s a lightweight `GET` request that returns the current status of the service.

---

## When to use

- **Monitoring** – Integrate into uptime tools (e.g. Pingdom, Datadog, New Relic) to alert if the API becomes unavailable.
- **Readiness Probes** – Use this endpoint in container orchestration systems (Kubernetes, Docker) to decide if an instance is ready to accept traffic.
- **Debugging** – Quickly confirm if issues are due to your integration or a wider service outage.
