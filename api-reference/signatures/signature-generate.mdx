# Generate `X-Custom-Signature`

Certain Waftpay APIs (notably **Payouts** and **Remittance**) require a request signature in the header **`X-Custom-Signature`**.
This signature proves the request came from you and wasn’t tampered with.

> TL;DR: Concatenate key fields in the exact order → sign with your **RSA private key** using **SHA-256** → Base64-encode → send as `X-Custom-Signature`.

---

## When it’s required

- **Payouts**: `POST /payments-api-service/v1/payouts` (or your deployed alias)
- **Remittance**: `POST /payments-api-service/v1/remittance`

These endpoints also require **Bearer auth** (product-scoped token) in addition to the signature.

## Fields used to build the signature

Use **exactly** the fields below, in this exact order:

1. `transaction.reference`
2. `transaction.amount`
3. `originator.country`
4. `recipient.service_code`

Concatenate their **values** with **no separators**.
