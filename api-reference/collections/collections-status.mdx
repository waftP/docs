## Request body

Provide **one** of the following fields:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `transaction_reference` | string | Your client reference used when creating the collection. |
| `request_uuid` | string | Request UUID returned by the platform (if provided). |
| `payment_uuid` | string | Waftpay payment UUID (numeric string). |

## Example response

```json
{
  "status": "200.100",
  "code": "ACCEPTED",
  "description": "Accepted for processing",
  "data": {
    "amount": 1000,
    "total_charges": 0,
    "total_amount": 1000,
    "transaction_reference": "TNC000008",
    "payment_uuid": "8363546214883574601",
    "payment_reference": "1RJITP5HLL",
    "state": "processing",
    "time_received": "2025-04-04T06:13:52.585619Z",
    "last_updated": "2025-04-04T06:15:10.102993Z"
  }
}
```

## Notes

- `state` can be `processing`, `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`.
- If the collection is not found, you will receive a `NOT_FOUND` response.
- `payment_reference` is a separate Waftpay reference; do not send it as `payment_uuid`.
- Errors follow the standard error shape. See [Errors](/errors).
