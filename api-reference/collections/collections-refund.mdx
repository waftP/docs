# Collections — Refunds

Refunds let you return funds to a payer after a successful collection. Refunds are **asynchronous**; you’ll receive `202 Accepted` if the request is queued, and a webhook (or status poll) for the final outcome.

---

## When can a refund be done?
- Original collection is **succeeded**.
- Provider supports refunds for the **service_code** used.
- Refund window hasn’t expired (per commercial terms).
- Amount is available and not locked by chargebacks or prior refunds.
- You own the original transaction (`client_id` match).

## Check refund reversal status (Try it)
<ParamField body="request_uuid" type="string" required placeholder="A333RTYUT" />


**Constraints**

- The original collection must be **`SUCCESS`**.
- Refund amount ≤ original `total_amount`.
- Refund window may be limited by MNO/bank policies (e.g., same-day).
- You must own the original `client_id` / `payment_uuid`.
- Final outcome depends on **downstream operator** acceptance.

> If partial refunds are disallowed in your contract, request the **full** original amount.

## Initiate a refund (API)

> **Note**: Endpoint path can vary by environment. If your gateway prefixes routes (e.g., `/user`), adjust `api:` accordingly.
